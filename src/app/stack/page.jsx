          I'm a full-stack developer who enjoys building fast, scalable web apps
          using tools like React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Next.js. I also
          use Figma, Notion, ClickUp, Trello, and Miro for everything from
          design collaboration to planning and task tracking. Whether it's
          mapping out a product roadmap, digging into the competition, or
          writing clean, maintainable code â€” I'm focused on solving real
          problems and creating great user experiences.
